                        <p>Business intelligence (BI) can add value to almost any business process, creating a comprehensive view and empowering teams to analyze their own data to find efficiencies and make better day-to-day decisions.

                           Digital transformation is now seen as a key strategic initiative and business intelligence tools have evolved to help companies make the most of their data investments. The response is the rise of modern business intelligence platforms that support data access, interactivity, analysis, discovery, sharing, and governance. While there are some great books about business intelligence that detail practical applications, this article will show off how some specific, big-name companies leverage modern business intelligence platforms.</p>

                           <h3>Using Machine Learning Algorithm<br>To Data Driven Approch <br>Data Visualization & Optimisation </h3>
                           <p>A data-driven approach is when decisions are based on analysis and interpretation of hard data rather than on observation. A data-driven approach ensures that solutions and plans are supported by sets of factual information, and not just hunches, feelings and anecdotal evidence.</p>
                           <p>There are different ways an algorithm can model a problem based on its interaction with the experience or environment or whatever we want to call the input data.

                              It is popular in machine learning and artificial intelligence textbooks to first consider the learning styles that an algorithm can adopt.
                              
                              There are only a few main learning styles or learning models that an algorithm can have and weâ€™ll go through them here with a few examples of algorithms and problem types that they suit.
                              
                              This taxonomy or way of organizing machine learning algorithms is useful because it forces you to think about the roles of the input data and the model preparation process and select one that is the most appropriate for your problem in order to get the best result.</p>
